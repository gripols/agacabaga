# MCV4U Asgmnt Repo

I keep all of my assignments for my MCV4U (Calculus and Vectors 12) class here.
All of my assignments are in TeX, PDFs not included.

If you wish to get a PDF, install Tex software on your machine,
clone this repo, and compile. If you wish to use a web application,
I recommend [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com).
